The project we are building is “Note Taking Website App Using JavaScript.” We all have a notes app on our mobiles or laptop. Note-taking websites are the online equivalent of notebooks, and because they are digital, they can do more for you than paper ever could. You can even build a more advanced level note-taking website, but we will keep it simple for now, as it is our first project!
